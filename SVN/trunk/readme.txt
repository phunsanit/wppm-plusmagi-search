Enhance your WordPress search with Ajax-powered live results, deep custom field indexing, and smart role-based access control.

== Description ==

PlusMagi Site Search is a comprehensive search solution designed to replace the limited default WordPress search. It provides a fast, modern, and highly relevant search experience by indexing content that WordPress usually ignores, such as Custom Fields and Meta Data.

Whether you are running a simple blog or a complex membership site, Smart Access Control ensures that search results are filtered based on the user's role. Editors see everything, while guests only see what is public.

== Features ==

*   **Ajax Live Search**: Instant search results with zero page refreshes.
*   **Smart Access Control**: Filters results for Public, Authors, and Admins dynamically.
*   **Deep Search Capability**:
	*   Post Titles and Content.
	*   Custom Fields (meta data like SKUs and internal codes).
	*   Taxonomies (Categories and Tags).
*   **Organized Search Results**: Results are grouped into Posts, Category, and Tag tabs.
*   **Visual Enhancements**: Shows featured images (thumbnails) in the search dropdown.
*   **Advanced Search Filters**: Use prefixes like `post:`, `tag:`, or `category:`.
*   **Developer Friendly**: Supports shortcode `[plusmagi-site-search]` and Block Editor.
*   **High Performance**: Optimized with lightweight Ajax calls.
